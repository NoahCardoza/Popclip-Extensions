# PopClip Extensions

A small collection of personal extensions I have written for PopClip.

## Asterisk

Surrounds the text you have selected with asterisks. I used this one to quickly bold
text on Quizlet flash cards.

## D2IP (and vice-versa)

Quickly translate IP address from dotted-decimal address to decimal format and vice versa.

## Follower

Follows all the redirects and saves the last redirect to your clipboard.

Utilizes [wheregoes.com](https://wheregoes.com/) to follow the redirects.
